# Hey-Bills Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## ðŸŽ¯ PROJECT OVERVIEW

**Project Name**: Hey-Bills - AI-Powered Financial Wellness Companion  
**Project Type**: Mobile App MVP Development  
**Timeline**: 1 Month  
**Target Launch**: End of Month 1  

---

## **Section 1: Goals and Background Context**

### **Goals**
Based on your Project Brief, here are the desired outcomes this PRD will deliver:

- **User Authentication & Onboarding**: Seamless Google/Email login experience for small business owners and freelancers
- **OCR Receipt Management**: Accurate scanning, categorization, and storage of digital receipts
- **Warranty Tracking System**: Proactive monitoring of product warranties with expiration alerts
- **Basic Analytics Dashboard**: Spending insights and financial visibility for better decision-making
- **MVP Launch Success**: Achieve target metrics within 1-month development timeline

### **Background Context**
Hey-Bills addresses a critical gap in the current financial management landscape. While numerous receipt organizer apps exist, they focus primarily on basic organization rather than maximizing the value of purchases. Small business owners, freelancers, and self-employed individuals face unique challenges: they need professional expense tracking for tax purposes, but also require intelligent insights to prevent costly mistakes and optimize spending.

The current market lacks a solution that combines receipt management with proactive financial guidance. Users lose money on expired warranties, make redundant purchases, and lack visibility into their spending patterns. Hey-Bills solves this by creating an AI-powered financial companion that not only organizes receipts but also provides contextual intelligence about purchases, warranty management, and spending optimization.
