  - 002_receipts_tables.sql  
  - 003_warranties_notifications.sql
  - 004_vector_embeddings.sql
  - 005_budgets_system_tables.sql
- Vector embeddings for RAG/AI features
- RLS policies structure
- Proper indexing strategy

**Missing:**

- Seed data population
- Testing of schema in actual Supabase instance

#### 4. Frontend Architecture (35% Complete)
**Implemented:**
- Flutter app structure with feature-based organization
- Basic routing setup (app_router.dart, route_paths.dart)
- Supabase service integration (supabase_service.dart)
- Authentication service foundation (auth_service.dart)
- Data models with JSON serialization:
  - User model
  - Receipt model  
  - Warranty model
  - OCR data model
- Basic theme configuration
- Error handling framework
- Sentry integration setup

**Missing:**
- Complete UI screens implementation (only splash, login skeleton exist)
- OCR service implementation
- Receipt management services
- Warranty tracking services
- Analytics dashboard
- Navigation implementation
- State management beyond basic Provider

### ‚ùå MAJOR GAPS TO ADDRESS

#### 1. Core Feature Implementation (0% Complete)
- **OCR Processing**: No actual OCR implementation
- **Receipt Management**: No CRUD operations implemented
- **Warranty Tracking**: No warranty management logic
- **Analytics Dashboard**: No analytics calculations or visualizations
- **Push Notifications**: Not implemented
- **Data Export**: Not implemented

#### 2. API Layer (5% Complete)
- Only health check endpoints exist
- No business logic endpoints
- No authentication middleware implementation
- No file upload handling
- No data validation

#### 3. UI/UX Implementation (10% Complete)
- Only basic screen structures exist
- No actual functional UI components
- No receipt scanning interface
- No warranty management interface
- No analytics dashboard
- No navigation between screens

#### 4. Testing Infrastructure (0% Complete)
- Test files exist but no actual tests implemented
- No integration tests
- No API testing
- No OCR accuracy testing
- No performance testing

#### 5. Deployment & DevOps (0% Complete)
- No CI/CD pipeline
- No deployment scripts
- No environment configuration for production
- No monitoring setup
- Supabase integration not configured with actual keys

### üéØ PRIORITY NEXT STEPS

#### Immediate (Week 1):
1. **Environment Setup**: Configure actual Supabase project and connection strings
2. **Database Deployment**: Run migrations against Supabase instance
3. **Basic Authentication**: Implement login/signup API endpoints and UI
4. **Core Navigation**: Implement app routing between main screens

#### Short-term (Weeks 2-3):
1. **Receipt Management**: Implement basic CRUD operations for receipts
2. **OCR Integration**: Implement Google ML Kit text recognition
3. **Basic UI**: Create functional receipt list and detail screens
4. **Image Upload**: Implement image capture and storage

#### Medium-term (Week 4):
1. **Warranty System**: Implement warranty tracking and alerts
2. **Basic Analytics**: Create spending overview dashboard
3. **Testing**: Add unit and integration tests
4. **Performance**: Optimize OCR and image processing

### üìã SPECIFIC TECHNICAL DEBT

#### Frontend:
- App config has placeholder Supabase URLs and keys
- OCR service exists but not implemented
- Navigation structure defined but not connected
- Models generated but not fully integrated

#### Backend:
- Routes directory has only health checks
- Middleware exists but auth implementation incomplete
- No actual business logic endpoints
- Error handling needs API-specific implementations

#### Database:
- Schema designed but not deployed
- No data seeding
- RLS policies defined but not tested
- Vector embeddings table ready but no embedding generation

### üîß COORDINATION INSIGHTS

#### Strengths:
- Excellent foundation with clear architecture
- Comprehensive planning and documentation
- Proper separation of concerns
- Good choice of technology stack
- Scalable database design

#### Risks:
- Gap between design and implementation is large
- Core features not yet functional
- No working authentication flow
- OCR functionality completely missing
- No testing coverage

### üìà SUCCESS METRICS TO TRACK

#### Technical:
- API endpoint coverage: 0/20 expected endpoints
- UI screen completion: 2/15 screens functional  
- Test coverage: 0% (target: 80%+)
- Database migration status: 0/5 migrations deployed

#### Functional:
- User can authenticate: No
- User can scan receipts: No
- User can track warranties: No  
- User can view analytics: No
- Push notifications work: No

This analysis provides a clear roadmap for agents to coordinate implementation efforts focusing on the most critical missing pieces first.
